# Minimal Bookmarks Page

A minimalist web page meant to be used as a new-tab page to show bookmarks statically.

The `index.html` page is generated by `generate.py`, from a plaintext config file. An example of the config file can be seen in `config.example.txt`

This repo can also be used as an unpacked Chrome extension, and can be added to Chrome by enabling Developer Mode in `chrome://extensions`
